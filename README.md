 EV Battery Health & Sustainability Intelligence

 Project Overview

This project presents an AI-driven predictive battery analytics framework designed to enhance lifecycle management of lithium-ion batteries used in Electric Vehicles (EVs).

Unlike traditional rule-based Battery Management Systems (BMS), this system predicts:

 State of Health (SoH)
 Remaining Useful Life (RUL)
 Early degradation anomalies
 Second-life reuse feasibility

The system transforms reactive battery monitoring into a predictive and intelligent analytics platform.



 Problem Statement

Conventional Battery Management Systems:
 Monitor voltage & temperature only
 Detect failures after they occur
 Do not predict long-term degradation
 Do not estimate Remaining Useful Life (RUL)
 Do not support intelligent reuse decisions

There is a need for an AI-based system that can forecast battery degradation, reduce unexpected failures, and support sustainable lifecycle management.



 Proposed Solution

An AI-powered predictive battery analytics system that:

 Uses NASA battery telemetry dataset (1.33M+ records)
 Integrates 1,80,000 synthetic EV fleet records
 Applies advanced feature engineering
 Uses XGBoost regression for nonlinear degradation modeling
 Implements GroupShuffleSplit to prevent data leakage
 Supports real-time streaming simulation
 Includes anomaly detection module
 Provides automated reuse decision engine
 Deploys predictions through Streamlit dashboard
